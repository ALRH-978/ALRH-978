# Project Synopsis

       In this project, I have examined Emergency Room Visit data across Denmark from 2019-2022. I began by looking at overall trends in hospitalizations and then narrowed my focus to the top diagnoses. Because of the potential disruption in the data from the introduction of a novel virus, COVID-19, I chose to look at psychiatric ER visits, the fourth most common reason for ER hospitalization. I examined these cases based on gender and found that female hospitalizations skewed younger than male hospitalizations, with their peak reaching about 100 more visits than male patients at their peak. Concerningly, the psychiatric hospitalization of young females has increased over time, with the largest overall increase occurring in the Midtjylland Region. This analysis can help guide precious mental health resources to support those most in need of preventative care.

Data sources: Statistics Denmark, "Admissions (LPR3) by region, diagnosis (23 groups), emergency/non-emergency, age and sex (2019-2022)". Statistics Denmark, "Population at the first day of the quarter by region, sex, age and marital status (2008Q1-2024Q1)"

# Credit Risk Analysis

This was a project I completed in my course with 365 Data Science: Complete Data Analyst Bootcamp

In this project, I am preparing a loan application dataset in order for it to be used in a machine-learning model to predict the probability of default. The text values have been changed to numeric values, monetary values from USD to EUR were calculated using daily exchange rate values, and principles of credit risk analysis guided decisions around categorizing applicants.

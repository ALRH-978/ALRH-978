# Introduction

My final project for my Data Analytics course will focus on Emergency Room visits in Denmark. Emergency Room visits are well known to be a significant area of cost for the healthcare system. Denmark has a universal health care system, where care is paid for through tax revenue.

My dataset comes from the Danish Statisk Bank. This is a collection of datasets that the government releases to the public. My specific dataset covers all of Denmark (all of the health regions) and is for the years 2006-2018, which was the most current years available.


# Highlights from the Analysis


- The most common reason that patients visit the ER in Denmark is for musculoskeletal issues

- There is not a significant difference between male and females in the total number of patient visits

- When digging deeper into the dataset, however, we do see a difference in when males/females are seeking care, with more males seeking it earlier in life and more females later in life.

- The highest number of patient visits were for those who were 10-24 years old

- Region Hovedstaden has by far the largest number of patient visits, but the incidence rate based on population is similar to Region Sj√¶lland and Region Syddanmark.

- The hypothesis testing conducted to determine if gender, age, or location was correlated to number of ER visits showed no signifcant relationship

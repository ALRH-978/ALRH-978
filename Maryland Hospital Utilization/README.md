# Maryland Hospital Utilization for Treatment of Female Reproductive Diseases in Patients Age 18-65+ (2018 - 2020)

This dashboard highlights the following:
- Average length of stay: ranging from 1.9 to 9.3 days
- Discharge rates per 100,000 population between 39.5 and 130.1 across different age groups
- Significant variations in average hospital costs per stay by county

The data underscores differences in hospital utilization and costs across age groups and counties, suggesting targeted areas for healthcare improvement and resource allocation in Maryland.

Note: The following counties were removed from the analysis because of insufficient data. 

 - Kent, Queen Anne's, Somerset, Talbot, and Worcester
   
Some statistics were not reported because the reporting cell draws from fewer than 2 hospitals, contains fewer than 11 discharges, has a relative standard error (standard error / weighted estimate) greater than 0.30 or equal to 0, or because the county or region is missing 2% or more of total discharges in the HCUP State Inpatient Database (SID) when compared to the Medicare Hospital Service Area File.

# Loneliness in Denmark

Den Nationale Sundhedsprofile provides statistical data about the health and mental health of the Danish population. 

While the results in Den Nationale Sundhedsprofil 2021 had many more categories, I focused on those that were relevant to ReDI School's programs.

The categories are the following:
- Considering beginning a educational program
- Unemployed
- Outside of the job market for other reasons
- Employed

Highlights: 
- "Employed" had the fewest respondents who reported lonliness
- The amount of respondents reporting lonliness were hightest among those who were "Outside of the job market for other resons" 
- Interestingly result is in the "Unemployed" category in 2021, where the number who reported they are lonely did not follow the same pattern of increasing lonliness

Overall, we can see that lonliness is a significant problem in Copenhagen and is becoming increasingly worse. While addressing lonliness is not the main focus of ReDI school's programs, here we can see that this reported benefit is an important finding considering the significant problem with lonliness in this population.
